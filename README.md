## Thinning Process for Tree Management

### Objective
The objective of the thinning process is to address the issue of trees growing too close to each other, which hinders the survival and growth of larger trees due to resource sharing. This process aims to optimize the overall health and sustainability of the tree population by identifying and removing less significant trees based on specific criteria.

### Methodology
1. **Data Mapping**: Utilizing data to map out tree positions using TreePosX, Y, Z coordinates.
2. **Clustering**: Applying clustering techniques, specifically unsupervised learning, to identify trees that can be cut down. This process is an example of unsupervised learning and is referred to as "Thinning."
3. **Thinning Criteria**: The criteria for thinning involves sorting the trees within each cluster based on a combination of factors specified by the features_for_removal variable. Then, a percentage of trees from the beginning of the sorted list is selected for removal.

### Dataset Details
The dataset used for this analysis includes the following details:
- TreeId: To identify each tree
- DBH (Diameter at Breast Height): Tree height in meters
- CrownDia: The width of the tree, measured between South to North and East to West
- CrownVol: The volume from the top of the tree to the bottom

### Conclusion
By leveraging clustering algorithms and unsupervised learning, the thinning process aims to promote the long-term health and growth of the remaining tree population. This structured and systematic methodology for tree management and optimization is essential for maintaining a healthy and sustainable tree population.
